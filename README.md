# SFML-project
animating Tux for simple movement

Hey everyone, this is my first project posted on Github.
This is a simple sfml project made using visual studio.
If you like to run the code yourself and try it, choose any IDE or editor and make the files.
Since this is a sfml project you have to link sfml library to your project folder.
To link SFML library to your project follow the following links.
  - For visual studio : https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/start-vc.php
  - For Code Blocks : https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/start-cb.php
  - For Linux : https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/start-linux.php
  - For Xcode(MacOs) : https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/compile-with-cmake.php
  
After linking you can make 2d graphics project using C++ quite easily.
Thank you!
